# DOGULE1_STATUS.md

## Phase 1 — Scaffolding

**Status:** Stations 1–10 complete and verified. Station 11 freshly restarted from the Station 10 baseline (branch `feature/station11-kunden-crud`) with layout/template loading fixed; implementation work resumes next.

### Station 1 — Tooling Check ✅

| Tool    | Version  | Status |
| ------- | -------- | ------ |
| Node.js | v24.9.0  | OK     |
| pnpm    | v10.19.0 | OK     |
| Git     | v2.51.1  | OK     |

All essential tools verified and operational.

### Station 2 — GitHub Base Repo ✅

- Git initialized on `main`, remote `origin` (`git@github.com:christiansamuels932/dogule1.git`) configured, baseline docs tracked, and initial commits pushed.
- SSH access confirmed; status/migration protocol enforced through `DOGULE1_STATUS.md`.

### Station 3 — Tooling & CI Pipeline ✅

- Added pnpm workspace (`apps/*`, `modules/*`, `packages/*`) and root tooling stack (ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Commitlint, lint-staged).
- Configured ESLint flat config + Prettier settings, `.gitignore`, and scripts (`lint`, `format`, `build`, `audit`, `prepare`, `lint-staged`).
- Husky hooks run lint-staged + commitlint; commitlint ignores `INIT_REPO_*` milestone commits.
- GitHub Actions cover lint/build/audit (push + PR; audit also weekly + manual). Branch protection = PR-only, required checks, linear history, no force push. Repo is public so protections apply for all contributors.

### Station 4 — Module Scaffolding ✅

- Created `/modules/{dashboard,kommunikation,kurse,kunden,hunde,kalender,trainer,finanzen,waren,shared}` with placeholder `index.html` per module.
- Each placeholder is German, minimal inline styles, matching baseline color-free spec.
- ESLint updated with CJS override; lint + format verified via Husky/lint-staged.
- Work lives on `feature/station4-modules` (`INIT_REPO_010`). PR: https://github.com/christiansamuels932/dogule1/pull/1

### Station 5 — Navigation Shell & Shared Styles ✅

- Added `apps/web/index.html` as the first app entrypoint with a simple German navigation UI that links to every module placeholder.
- Created `modules/shared/shared.css` as the common baseline (system font stack, spacing, colors, list/link styles) and wired it into the new entrypoint.
- Changes delivered on `feature/station5-navigation-shared` (`INIT_REPO_014`); branch merged back to `main`.

**Next Action:** Station 11 — data transport + persistence strategy.

### Station 6 — Functional Routing Shell ✅

- Added a lightweight hash router (`apps/web/main.js`) that swaps module placeholders into a live region, keeps navigation state in sync, and reports fetch failures through inline messaging + console error codes.
- Updated the navigation shell (`apps/web/index.html`) to use hash links/data-route attributes, include the new content container, and load the router script; shared styles now highlight the active link and size the content area (`modules/shared/shared.css`).
- Created a tiny Node-based dev server (`scripts/dev-server.cjs`) plus `pnpm dev` for serving `apps/web` while routing through static module files, with lint config extended to cover CommonJS scripts.
- Work tracked on `feature/station6-functional-routing` (`INIT_REPO_015`). PR: https://github.com/christiansamuels932/dogule1/pull/4

### Station 7 — Unified Layout & UI Structure ✅

- Introduced a shared layout demo + stylesheet (`modules/shared/layout.html` / `layout.css`) with persistent header/footer, navigation, and main content frame to reuse across modules.
- Router now bootstraps the shared layout before loading module HTML, injecting module content into `#dogule-main` so the frame stays intact; hash navigation still drives module switching with consistent aria states.
- Shared base styles expanded (`modules/shared/shared.css`) to cover typography, focus outlines, and spacing utilities; added `pnpm dev`-ready layout assets for Station 7 tasks.
- Work lives on `feature/station7-ui-structure` (`INIT_REPO_016`). PR: https://github.com/christiansamuels932/dogule1/pull/5

### Station 8 — Standardized Module Interfaces ✅

- Every module now ships with `index.html` + `index.js`, exposing a standard `initModule(container)` entry used by the router; shared layout’s `<main id="dogule-main">` is the mounting target.
- Router (`apps/web/main.js`) dynamically imports each module bundle, validates the exported initializer, and renders localized error UI on failure; navigation links now cover all modules with hash routes and active-state attributes.
- Layout navigation exposes German labels for all modules, ensuring hash changes stay in sync whether triggered by clicks or manual URL edits.
- Work delivered on `feature/station8-module-interfaces` (`INIT_REPO_017`). PR: https://github.com/christiansamuels932/dogule1/pull/6

### Station 9 — Shared UI Components & Module Integration ✅

- Added `modules/shared/components/` with reusable templates, CSS, and JS helpers for buttons, cards, section headers, badges, notices, empty states, form rows, and navigation highlighting (`nav__link--active` + `aria-current="page"`).
- Router updates keep nav state in sync via shared data-route hooks; focus-visible styles remain centralized in shared CSS.
- Dashboard and Kunden modules now render exclusively through shared components (cards, notices, badges, buttons, form rows, empty states) with German copy and no ad-hoc styles.
- Lint/build green; work lives on `feature/station9-ui-components` (`INIT_REPO_018–025`). PR: https://github.com/christiansamuels932/dogule1/pull/9

### Station 10 — Centralized Mock API & Module Wiring ✅

- Added `modules/shared/api/` with delay helper, seeded in-memory DB, CRUD stubs, and barrel exports so modules can read/write mock data with simulated latency.
- Seeded realistic mock datasets for Kunden, Kurse, and Trainer to unblock UI development without a backend.
- Kunden and Kurse modules now fetch via `list("<table>")`, render shared-component cards/lists dynamically, and surface localized empty/error states while reusing existing UI primitives.
- Validation via `pnpm lint` / `pnpm build`; work tracked on `feature/station10-data-mocks` (`INIT_REPO_026–029`). PR: https://github.com/christiansamuels932/dogule1/pull/11

### Station 11 — Kunden CRUD (Phase 1) ✅

- Rebuilt Kunden data model across the mock API by seeding `vorname`, `nachname`, `email`, `telefon`, `adresse`, `notizen`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, ensuring `createKunde`/`updateKunde` keep timestamps fresh.
- Polished the Kunden list/detail/form flows to show the rich fields with German copy, added delete confirmation, inline toasts, and error handling so CRUD failures don’t strand the UI.
- Added optimistic button states, validation, and navigation feedback for create/edit/delete; shared helpers now format names, timestamps, and optional values consistently.
- Security check fix: pinned `js-yaml@^4.1.1` via `pnpm.overrides` to satisfy the audit GitHub Action.
- Local validation: `pnpm audit`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`; branch `feature/station11-kunden-crud` pushed with PR **Station 11 – Kunden data model + UX polish** (#15) awaiting review.
