# DOGULE1 – MIGRATION PROTOCOL

### 🎯 PURPOSE
Guarantee full continuity of project context between chats.

---

## 1 — STATUS FILE
- File: `DOGULE1_STATUS.md`  
- Location: root folder `dogule1/`  
- Content: phase, current station, next action, progress, summary.  
- Updated by Codex after every station.

---

## 2 — TRIGGER FOR MIGRATION
Migration occurs when:  
1. A station completes.  
2. Chat becomes slow or crowded.

---

## 3 — MIGRATION STEPS
1. Export or copy the latest `DOGULE1_STATUS.md`.  
2. Open a new chat named for the next station.  
3. Paste the status content as the first message.  
4. ChatGPT acknowledges and continues from there.

---

## 4 — REDUNDANCY
- Each status version remains in Git history.  
- Optional mirror on NAS under `/projects/dogule1/logs/`.

---

## ✅ RESULT
Migration is loss-free and project continuity is guaranteed.
